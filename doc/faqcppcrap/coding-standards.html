</p><h3>[25.1] What are some good C++ coding standards?</h3>
<p>Thank you for reading this answer rather than just trying to set your own
coding standards.
</p><p>But beware that some people on <a href="news:comp.lang.c++"><tt>comp.lang.c++</tt></a> are very sensitive
on this issue.  Nearly every software engineer has, at some point, been
exploited by someone who used coding standards as a "power play." Furthermore
some attempts to set C++ coding standards have been made by those who didn't
know what they were talking about, so the standards end up being based on what
<em>was</em> the state-of-the-art when the standards setters where writing code.
Such impositions generate an attitude of mistrust for coding standards.
</p><p>Obviously anyone who asks this question wants to be trained so they
<em>don't</em> run off on their own ignorance, but nonetheless posting a
question such as this one to <a href="news:comp.lang.c++"><tt>comp.lang.c++</tt></a> tends to generate
more heat than light.

</p><h3>[25.2] Are coding standards necessary?  Are they
sufficient?</h3>
<p>Coding standards do not make non-OO programmers into OO programmers; only
training and experience do that.  If coding standards have merit, it is that
they discourage the petty fragmentation that occurs when large organizations
coordinate the activities of diverse groups of programmers.
</p><p>But you really want more than a coding standard.  The structure provided by
coding standards gives neophytes one less degree of freedom to worry about,
which is good.  However pragmatic guidelines should go well beyond
pretty-printing standards.  Organizations need a consistent <em>philosophy</em>
of design and implementation.  E.g., strong or weak typing?  references or
pointers in interfaces?  stream I/O or stdio?  should C++ code call C code?
vice versa?  how should <a indepth="true" href="abcs.html#[22.3]">ABCs<!--rawtext:[22.3]:rawtext--></a> be used?  should inheritance
be used as an implementation technique or as a specification technique?  what
testing strategy should be employed?  inspection strategy?  should interfaces
uniformly have a <tt>get()</tt> and/or <tt>set()</tt> member function for each data member?
should interfaces be designed from the outside-in or the inside-out?  should
errors be handled by <tt>try</tt>/<tt>catch</tt>/<tt>throw</tt> or by return codes?  etc.
</p><p>What is needed is a "pseudo standard" for detailed <em>design.</em> I recommend
a three-pronged approach to achieving this standardization: training,
<a indepth="true" href="how-to-learn-cpp.html#[26.1]">mentoring<!--rawtext:[26.1]:rawtext--></a>, and libraries.  Training provides "intense
instruction," mentoring allows OO to be caught rather than just taught, and
high quality C++ class libraries provide "long term instruction." There is a
thriving commercial market for all three kinds of "training." Advice by
organizations who have been through the mill is consistent: <em>Buy, Don't
Build.</em> Buy libraries, buy training, buy tools, buy consulting.  Companies
who have attempted to become a self-taught tool-shop as well as an
application/system shop have found success difficult.
</p><p>Few argue that coding standards are "ideal," or even "good," however they are
necessary in the kind of organizations/situations described above.
</p><p>The following FAQs provide some basic guidance in conventions and styles.
</p><p><small>[&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a> |&nbsp;<a href="#bottom">Bottom</a> |&nbsp;<a indepth="true" href="private-inheritance.html">Previous&nbsp;section</a> |&nbsp;<a indepth="true" href="how-to-learn-cpp.html">Next&nbsp;section</a> ]</small>

</p><h3>[25.3] Should our organization determine coding standards
from our C experience?</h3>
<p>No!
</p><p>No matter how vast your C experience, no matter how advanced your C expertise,
being a good C programmer does not make you a good C++ programmer.  Converting
from C to C++ is more than just learning the syntax and semantics of the
<tt>++</tt> part of C++.  Organizations who want the promise of OO, but who fail
to put the "OO" into "OO programming", are fooling themselves; the balance
sheet will show their folly.
</p><p>C++ coding standards should be tempered by C++ experts.  Asking
<a href="news:comp.lang.c++"><tt>comp.lang.c++</tt></a> is a start.  Seek out experts who can help guide
you away from pitfalls.  Get training.  Buy libraries and see if "good"
libraries pass your coding standards.  Do <em>not</em> set standards by yourself
unless you have considerable experience in C++.  Having no standard is better
than having a bad standard, since improper "official" positions "harden" bad
brain traces.  There is a thriving market for both C++ training and libraries
from which to pool expertise.
</p><p>One more thing: whenever something is in demand, the potential for charlatans
increases.  Look before you leap.  Also ask for student-reviews from past
companies, since not even expertise makes someone a good communicator.
Finally, select a practitioner who can teach, not a full time teacher who has a
passing knowledge of the language/paradigm.

</p><h3>[25.4] What's the difference between <tt>&lt;xxx&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;xxx.h&gt;</tt> headers? <img src="new.gif" alt="NEW!"></h3>
<small><em>[Recently created thanks to <a href="mailto:brahms@mindspring.com">Stan Brown</a> (on 1/00).  <a indepth="true" href="smalltalk.html#[27.3]">Click here to go to the next FAQ in the "chain" of recent changes<!--rawtext:[27.3]:rawtext--></a>.]</em></small>
<p>The headers in ISO Standard C++ don't have a <tt>.h</tt> suffix.  This is
something the standards committee changed from former practice.  The details
are different between headers that existed in C and those that are specific to
C++.
</p><p>The C++ standard library is guaranteed to have 18 standard headers from the C
language.  These headers come in two standard flavors, <tt>&lt;cxxx&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;xxx.h&gt;</tt> (where <tt>xxx</tt> is the basename of the header, such as
<tt>stdio</tt>, <tt>stdlib</tt>, etc).  These two flavors are identical except
the <tt>&lt;cxxx&gt;</tt> versions provide their declarations in the <tt>std</tt>
namespace only, and the <tt>&lt;xyz.h&gt;</tt> versions make them available both in
<tt>std</tt> namespace and in the global namespace.  The committee did it this
way so that existing C code could continue to be compiled in C++, however the
<tt>&lt;xyz.h&gt;</tt> versions are deprecated, meaning they are standard now but
might not be part of the standard in future revisions.  (See ISO clause D and
subclause D.5 of the <a indepth="true" href="big-picture.html#[6.12]">ISO C++ standard<!--rawtext:[6.12]:rawtext--></a>.)
</p><p>The C++ standard library is also guaranteed to have 32 additional standard
headers that have no direct counterparts in C, such as <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt>,
<tt>&lt;string&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&lt;new&gt;</tt>.  You may see things like <tt>#include&nbsp;&lt;iostream.h&gt;</tt> and so on in old code, and some compiler vendors offer
<tt>.h</tt> versions for that reason.  But be careful: the <tt>.h</tt> versions,
if available, may differ from the standard versions.  And if you compile some
units of a program with, for example, <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> and others with
<tt>&lt;iostream.h&gt;</tt>, the program may not work.
</p><p>For new projects, use only the <tt>&lt;xxx&gt;</tt> headers, not the <tt>&lt;xxx.h&gt;</tt>
headers.
</p><p>When modifying or extending existing code that uses the old header names, you
should probably follow the practice in that code unless there's some important
reason to switch to the standard headers (such as a facility available in
standard <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> that was not available in the vendor's
<tt>&lt;iostream.h&gt;</tt>).  If you need to standardize existing code, make sure to
change all C++ headers in all program units including external libraries that
get linked in to the final executable.
</p><p>All of this affects the standard headers only.  You're free to name your own
headers anything you like; see <a indepth="true" href="coding-standards.html#[25.8]">[25.8]</a>.

</p><h3>[25.5] Is the <tt>?:</tt> operator evil since it can be used to create
unreadable code?</h3>
<p>No, but as always, remember that readability is one of the most important
things.
</p><p>Some people feel the <tt>?:</tt> ternary operator should be avoided because they find
it confusing at times compared to the good old <tt>if</tt> statement.  In many cases
<tt>?:</tt> tends to make your code more difficult to read (and therefore you should
replace those usages of <tt>?:</tt> with <tt>if</tt> statements), but there are times when
the <tt>?:</tt> operator is clearer since it can emphasize what's really happening,
rather than the fact that there's an <tt>if</tt> in there somewhere.
</p><p>Let's start with a really simple case.  Suppose you need to print the result of
a function call.  In that case you should put the real goal (printing) at the
beginning of the line, and bury the function call within the line since it's
relatively incidental (this left-right thing is based on the intuitive notion
that most developers think the first thing on a line is the most important
thing):
</p><p><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Preferred&nbsp;(emphasizes&nbsp;the&nbsp;major&nbsp;goal&nbsp;—&nbsp;printing):</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;funct();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Not&nbsp;as&nbsp;good&nbsp;(emphasizes&nbsp;the&nbsp;minor&nbsp;goal&nbsp;—&nbsp;a&nbsp;function&nbsp;call):</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functAndPrintOn(cout);
</tt>
</p><p>Now let's extend this idea to the <tt>?:</tt> operator.  Suppose your real goal is to
print something, but you need to do some incidental decision logic to figure
out what should be printed.  Since the printing is the most important thing
conceptually, we prefer to put it first on the line, and we prefer to bury the incidental
decision logic.  In the example code below, variable <tt>n</tt> represents the
number of senders of a message; the message itself is being printed to
<tt>cout</tt>:
</p><p><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt><em>/*...*/</em><tt>;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;number&nbsp;of&nbsp;senders</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Preferred&nbsp;(emphasizes&nbsp;the&nbsp;major&nbsp;goal&nbsp;—&nbsp;printing):</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;"Please&nbsp;get&nbsp;back&nbsp;to&nbsp;"&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;(n==1&nbsp;?&nbsp;"me"&nbsp;:&nbsp;"us")&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;"&nbsp;soon!\n";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Not&nbsp;as&nbsp;good&nbsp;(emphasizes&nbsp;the&nbsp;minor&nbsp;goal&nbsp;—&nbsp;a&nbsp;decision):</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;"Please&nbsp;get&nbsp;back&nbsp;to&nbsp;";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;(n==1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;"me";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;"us";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;"&nbsp;soon!\n";
</tt>
</p><p>All that being said, you can get pretty outrageous and unreadable code ("write
only code") using various combinations of <tt>?:</tt>, <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, <tt>||</tt>, etc.  For example,
</p><p><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Preferred&nbsp;(obvious&nbsp;meaning):</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;(f())<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Not&nbsp;as&nbsp;good&nbsp;(harder&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand):</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f()&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;g();
</tt>
</p><p>Personally I think the explicit <tt>if</tt> example is clearer since it emphasizes the
major thing that's going on (a decision based on the result of calling <tt>f()</tt>)
rather than the minor thing (calling <tt>f()</tt>).  In other words, the use of <tt>if</tt>
here is <em>good</em> for precisely the same reason that it was <em>bad</em>
above: we want to major on the majors and minor on the minors.
</p><p>In any event, don't forget that readability is the goal (at least it's one of
the goals).  Your goal should <em>not</em> be to avoid certain syntactic
constructs such as <tt>?:</tt> or <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> or <tt>||</tt> or <tt>if</tt> — or even <tt>goto</tt>.  If
you sink to the level of a "Standards Bigot," you'll ultimately embarass
yourself since there are always counterexamples to any syntax-based rule.  If
on the other hand you emphasize broad goals and guidelines (e.g., "major on the
majors," or "put the most important thing first on the line," or even "make
sure your code is obvious and readable"), you're usually much better off.
</p><p>Code must be written to be read, not by the compiler, but by another human
being.

</p><h3>[25.6] Should I declare locals in the middle of a function
or at the top?</h3>
<p>Declare near first use.
</p><p>An object is initialized (constructed) the moment it is declared.  If you don't
have enough information to initialize an object until half way down the
function, you should create it half way down the function when it can be
initialized correctly.  Don't initialize it to an "empty" value at the top then
"assign" it later.  The reason for this is runtime performance.  Building an
object correctly is faster than building it incorrectly and remodeling it
later.  Simple examples show a factor of 350% speed hit for simple classes
like <tt>String</tt>.  Your mileage may vary; surely the overall system degradation
will be less that 350%, but there <em>will</em> be degradation.
<em>Unnecessary</em> degradation.
</p><p>A common retort to the above is: "we'll provide <tt>set()</tt> member functions for
every datum in our objects so the cost of construction will be spread out."
This is worse than the performance overhead, since now you're introducing a
maintenance nightmare.  Providing a <tt>set()</tt> member function for every datum is
tantamount to <tt>public</tt> data: you've exposed your implementation technique to
the world.  The only thing you've hidden is the physical <em>names</em> of your
member objects, but the fact that you're using a <tt>List</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> and a
<tt>float</tt>, for example, is open for all to see.
</p><p>Bottom line: Locals should be declared near their first use.  Sorry that this
isn't familiar to C experts, but new doesn't necessarily mean bad.

</p><h3>[25.7] What source-file-name convention is best?  <tt>foo.cpp</tt>?
<tt>foo.C</tt>?  <tt>foo.cc</tt>?</h3>
<p>If you already have a convention, use it.  If not, consult your compiler to see
what the compiler expects.  Typical answers are: <tt>.C</tt>, <tt>.cc</tt>,
<tt>.cpp</tt>, or <tt>.cxx</tt> (naturally the <tt>.C</tt> extension assumes a
case-sensitive file system to distinguish <tt>.C</tt> from <tt>.c</tt>).
</p><p>We've often used both <tt>.cpp</tt> for our C++ source files, and we have also
used <tt>.C</tt>.  In the latter case, we supply the compiler option forces .c
files to be treated as C++ source files (<tt>-Tdp</tt> for IBM CSet++,
<tt>-cpp</tt> for Zortech C++, <tt>-P</tt> for Borland C++, etc.) when porting
to case-insensitive file systems.  None of these approaches have any striking
technical superiority to the others; we generally use whichever technique is
preferred by our customer (again, these issues are dominated by business
considerations, not by technical considerations).

<p>If you already have a convention, use it.  If not, and if you don't need your
editor to distinguish between C and C++ files, simply use <tt>.h</tt>.
Otherwise use whatever the editor wants, such as <tt>.H</tt>, <tt>.hh</tt>, or
<tt>.hpp</tt>.
</p><p>We've tended to use either <tt>.hpp</tt> or <tt>.h</tt> for our C++ header files.

</p><h3>[25.9] Are there any lint-like guidelines for C++?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are some practices which are generally considered dangerous.
However none of these are universally "bad," since situations arise when
even the worst of these is needed:
</p><ul>
<li>A <tt>class</tt> <tt>Fred</tt>'s assignment <tt>operator</tt> should return <tt>*this</tt> as a
<tt>Fred&amp;</tt> (allows chaining of assignments)</li>
<li>A class with any <a indepth="true" href="virtual-functions.html"><tt>virtual</tt><!--rawtext:[20]:rawtext--></a> functions
ought to have a <a indepth="true" href="virtual-functions.html#[20.4]">virtual destructor<!--rawtext:[20.4]:rawtext--></a></li>
<li>A class with any of {destructor, assignment <tt>operator</tt>, copy
constructor} generally needs all 3</li>
<li>A <tt>class</tt> <tt>Fred</tt>'s copy constructor and assignment <tt>operator</tt> should
have <tt>const</tt> in the parameter: respectively <tt>Fred::Fred(const&nbsp;Fred&amp;)</tt> and
<tt>Fred&amp;&nbsp;Fred::operator=&nbsp;(const&nbsp;Fred&amp;)</tt></li>
<li>When initializing an object's member objects in the constructor,
always use initialization lists rather than assignment.  The performance
difference for user-defined classes can be substantial (3x!)</li>
<li>Assignment operators should make sure that
<a indepth="true" href="assignment-operators.html#[12.1]">self assignment<!--rawtext:[12.1]:rawtext--></a> does nothing,
<a indepth="true" href="assignment-operators.html#[12.2]">otherwise you may have a disaster<!--rawtext:[12.2]:rawtext--></a>.  In some
cases, this may require you to <a indepth="true" href="assignment-operators.html#[12.3]">add an explicit
test to your assignment operators<!--rawtext:[12.3]:rawtext--></a>.</li>
<li>In classes that define both <tt>+=</tt> and <tt>+</tt>, <tt>a&nbsp;+=&nbsp;b</tt>
and <tt>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b</tt> should generally do the same thing; ditto for the other
identities of built-in types (e.g., <tt>a&nbsp;+=&nbsp;1</tt> and <tt>++a</tt>;
<tt>p[i]</tt> and <tt>*(p+i)</tt>; etc).  This can be enforced by writing the
binary operations using the <tt>op=</tt> forms.  E.g.,
<p><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;operator+&nbsp;(const&nbsp;Fred&amp;&nbsp;a,&nbsp;const&nbsp;Fred&amp;&nbsp;b)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;ans&nbsp;=&nbsp;a;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ans&nbsp;+=&nbsp;b;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;ans;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</tt>
</p><p>This way the "constructive" binary operators don't even need to be
<a indepth="true" href="friends.html">friends<!--rawtext:[14]:rawtext--></a>.  But it is sometimes possible to more efficiently
implement common operations (e.g., if <tt>class</tt> <tt>Fred</tt> is actually <tt>String</tt>, and
<tt>+=</tt> has to reallocate/copy string memory, it may be better to know the
eventual length from the beginning).</p></li>

<tt>ncqWith</tt> <tt>ksldjfTheir</tt> <tt>nmdsadType</tt>.  And then there are the
folks with a Unix C background, who <tt>abbr</tt> <tt>evthng</tt> <tt>n</tt>
<tt>use</tt> <tt>vry</tt> <tt>srt</tt> <tt>idntfr</tt> <tt>nms</tt>.  (<tt>AND</tt>
<tt>THE</tt> <tt>FORTRN</tt> <tt>PRGMRS</tt> <tt>LIMIT</tt> <tt>EVRYTH</tt>
<tt>TO</tt> <tt>SIX</tt> <tt>LETTRS</tt>.)
</p><p>So there is no universal standard.  If your organization has a particular
coding standard for identifier names, use it.  But starting another Jihad over
this will create a lot more heat than light.  From a business perspective,
there are only two things that matter: The code should be generally readable,
and everyone in the organization should use the same style.

</p><h3>[25.11] Are there any other sources of coding standards?</h3>
<p>Yep, there are several.
</p><p>Here are a few sources that you might be able to use as starting points for
developing your organization's coding standards:
