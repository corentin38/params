</p><h3>[6.1] Is C++ a practical language?</h3>
<p>Yes.
</p><p>C++ is a practical tool.  <a indepth="true" href="big-picture.html#[6.2]">It's not perfect<!--rawtext:[6.2]:rawtext--></a>, but
it's useful.
</p><p>In the world of industrial software, C++ is viewed as a solid, mature,
mainstream tool.  It has widespread industry support which makes it "good" from
an overall business perspective.

</p><h3>[6.2] Is C++ a perfect language?</h3>
<p>Nope.
</p><p>C++ wasn't designed to demonstrate what a perfect OO language looks like.  It
was designed to be a practical tool for solving real world problems.  It has a
few warts, but the only place where it's appropriate to keep fiddling with
something until it's perfect is in a pure academic setting.  That wasn't C++'s
goal.

</p><h3>[6.3] What's the big deal with OO?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented techniques are the best way we know of to develop large,
complex software applications and systems.
</p><p>OO hype: the software industry is "failing" to meet demands for large, complex
software systems.  But this "failure" is actually due to our <em>successes:</em>
our successes have propelled users to ask for more.  Unfortunately we created a
market hunger that the "structured" analysis, design and programming techniques
couldn't satisfy.  This required us to create a better paradigm.
</p><p>C++ is an OO programming language.  C++ can also be used as a traditional
programming language (as "as a better C").  However if you use it "as a better
C," don't expect to get the benefits of object-oriented programming.

</p><h3>[6.4] Is C++ better than Ada? (or Visual Basic, C, FORTRAN,
Pascal, Smalltalk, or any other language?)</h3>
<p>This question generates much <em>much</em> more heat than light.  Please read
the following before posting some variant of this question.
</p><p>In 99% of the cases, programming language selection is dominated by business
considerations, <em>not</em> by technical considerations.  Things that
<em>really</em> end up mattering are things like availability of a programming
environment for the development machine, availability of runtime environment(s)
for the deployment machine(s), licensing/legal issues of the runtime and/or
development environments, availability of trained developers, availability of
consulting services, and corporate culture/politics.  These business
considerations generally play a much greater role than compile time
performance, runtime performance, static <i>vs.</i> dynamic typing, static <i>vs.</i> dynamic
binding, etc.
</p><p>Anyone who argues in favor of one language over another in a purely technical
manner (i.e., who ignores the dominant business issues) exposes themself as a
techie weenie, and deserves not to be heard.

</p><h3>[6.5] Who uses C++?</h3>
<p>Lots and lots of companies and government sites.  Lots.
</p><p>The number of C++ developers increases 20-30% every year.  You can imagine that
five people are becoming C++ developers while you read this FAQ.
</p><p>Growth is one of several <a indepth="true" href="big-picture.html#[6.7]">critical features of C++<!--rawtext:[6.7]:rawtext--></a>.

</p><h3>[6.6] How long does it take to learn OO/C++?</h3>
<p>Companies successfully teach standard industry "short courses," where a
university semester course is compressed into one 40 hour work week.  But
regardless of where you get your training, make sure the courses have a
hands-on element, since most people learn best when they have projects to help
the concepts "gel." But even if they have the <em>best</em> training, they're
not ready yet.
</p><p>It takes 6-12 months to become proficient in OO/C++.  Less if the developers
have easy access to a "local" body of experts, more if there isn't a "good"
general purpose C++ class library available.  To become one of these experts
who can mentor others takes around 3 years.
</p><p>Some people never make it.  You don't have a chance unless you are teachable
and have personal drive.  As a bare minimum on "teachability," you have to be
able to admit when you've been wrong.  As a bare minimum on "drive," you must be
willing to put in some extra hours (it's a <em>lot</em> easier to learn some new
facts than it is to change your paradigm [i.e., to change the <em>way</em> you
think; to change your notion of goodness; to change your mental model of the
world of technology]).
</p><p>Two things you <em>should</em> do:

</p><h3>[6.8] Are <tt>virtual</tt> functions (dynamic binding) central to
OO/C++? <img src="updated.gif" alt="UPDATED!"></h3>
<small><em>[Recently reworded the second paragraph thanks to <a href="mailto:brahms@mindspring.com">Stan Brown</a> (on 1/00).  <a indepth="true" href="big-picture.html#[6.11]">Click here to go to the next FAQ in the "chain" of recent changes<!--rawtext:[6.11]:rawtext--></a>.]</em></small>
<p><em>Yes!</em>
</p><p>Without <a indepth="true" href="virtual-functions.html">virtual functions<!--rawtext:[20]:rawtext--></a>, C++ wouldn't be
object-oriented.  <a indepth="true" href="operator-overloading.html">Operator overloading<!--rawtext:[13]:rawtext--></a> and
non-<tt>virtual</tt> member functions are great, but they are, after all, just
syntactic sugar for the more typical C notion of passing a pointer to a
<tt>struct</tt> to a function.  STL and other "generic programming" techniques are
great too, but <tt>virtual</tt> functions are still at the heart of object-oriented
programming using C++.
</p><p>From a business perspective, there is very little reason to switch from
straight C to C++ without virtual functions (we'll ignore generic programming
and STL in this FAQ).  Technical people often think that there is a large
difference between C and non-OO C++, but without OO, difference usually isn't
enough to justify the cost of training developers, new tools, etc.  In other
words, if I were to advise a manager regarding whether to switch from C to
non-OO C++ (i.e., to switch languages but not paradigms), I'd probably
discourage him or her unless there were compelling tool-oriented reasons.  From
a business perspective, OO can help make systems extensible andadaptable, but
just the syntax of C++ classes without OO may not even reduce the maintenance
cost, and it surely adds to the training cost significantly.
</p><p>Bottom line: C++ without <tt>virtual</tt> is not OO.  Programming with classes but
without dynamic binding is called "object based," but not "object oriented."
Throwing out <tt>virtual</tt> functions is the same as throwing out OO.  All you have
left is object-based programming, similar to the original Ada language (the new
Ada language, by the way, supports true OO rather than just object-based
programming).

</p><h3>[6.9] I'm from Missouri.  Can you give me a simple
reason why <tt>virtual</tt> functions (dynamic binding) make a big difference?</h3>
<p>Overview: Dynamic binding can improve reuse by letting <em>old</em> code call
<em>new</em> code.
</p><p>Before OO came along, reuse was accomplished by having new code call old code.
For example, a programmer might write some code that called some reusable code
such as <tt>printf()</tt>.
</p><p>With OO, reuse can also be accomplished by having <em>old</em> code call
<em>new</em> code.  For example, a programmer might write some code that is
called by a framework that was written by their great, great grandfather.
There's no need to change great-great-grandpa's code.  In fact, it doesn't even
need to be recompiled.  Even if all you have left is the object file and the
source code that great-great-grandpa wrote was lost 25 years ago, that ancient
object file will call the new extension without anything falling apart.
</p><p><em>That</em> is extensibility, and <em>that</em> is OO.

</p><h3>[6.10] Is C++ backward compatible with ANSI/ISO-C?</h3>
<p>Almost.
</p><p>C++ is as close as possible to compatible with C, but no closer.  In practice,
the major difference is that C++ requires prototypes, and that <tt>f()</tt> declares a
function that takes no parameters (in C, <tt>f()</tt> is the same as <tt>f(...)</tt>).
</p><p>There are some very subtle differences as well, like <tt>sizeof('x')</tt> is equal to
<tt>sizeof(char)</tt> in C++ but is equal to <tt>sizeof(int)</tt> in C.  Also, C++ puts
structure "tags" in the same namespace as other names, whereas C requires an
explicit <tt>struct</tt> (e.g., the <tt>typedef&nbsp;struct&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;Fred;</tt> technique still
works, but is redundant in C++).

</p><h3>[6.11] Is C++ standardized? <img src="updated.gif" alt="UPDATED!"></h3>
<small><em>[Recently changed "American National Standards Organization" to "American National Standards Institute" thanks to <a href="mailto:mjones@mobile.global.slb.com">Mark Jones</a>; also reworded first paragraph thanks to <a href="mailto:brahms@mindspring.com">Stan Brown</a> (on 1/00).  <a indepth="true" href="big-picture.html#[6.12]">Click here to go to the next FAQ in the "chain" of recent changes<!--rawtext:[6.12]:rawtext--></a>.]</em></small>
<p>Yes.
</p><p>The C++ standard was finalized and adopted by ISO (International Organization
for Standardization) as well as several national standards organizations such
as ANSI (The American National Standards Institute), BSI (The British Standards
Institute), DIN (The German National Standards Organization).  The ISO standard
has been finalized and adopted by unanimous vote November 14, 1997.
</p><p>The ANSI-C++ committee is called "X3J16".  The ISO C++ standards group is
called "WG21".  The major players in the ANSI/ISO C++ standards process
includes just about everyone: representatives from Australia, Canada, Denmark,
France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the UK,
and the USA, along with representatives from about a hundred companies and many
interested individuals.  Major players include AT&amp;T, Ericsson, Digital,
Borland, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Mentor Graphics, Microsoft, Silicon Graphics,
Sun Microsystems, and Siemens.  After about 8 years of work, this standard is
now complete.  On November 14, 1997, the standard was approved by a unanimous
vote of the countries that had representatives present in Morristown.
