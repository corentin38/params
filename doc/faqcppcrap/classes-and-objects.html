</p><h3>[7.1] What is a class?</h3>
<p>The fundamental building block of OO software.
</p><p>A <tt>class</tt> defines a data type, much like a <tt>struct</tt> would be in C.  In a
computer science sense, a type consists of both a set of states <em>and</em> a
set of operations which transition between those states.  Thus <tt>int</tt> is a type
because it has both a set of states <em>and</em> it has operations like <tt>i&nbsp;+&nbsp;j</tt> or <tt>i++</tt>, etc.  In exactly the same way, a <tt>class</tt> provides a set
of (usually <tt>public:</tt>) operations, and a set of (usually non-<tt>public:</tt>) data
bits representing the abstract values that instances of the type can have.
</p><p>You can imagine that <tt>int</tt> is a <tt>class</tt> that has member functions called
<tt>operator++</tt>, etc. (<tt>int</tt> isn't really a <tt>class</tt>, but the basic analogy is
this: a <tt>class</tt> is a type, much like <tt>int</tt> is a type.)
</p><p>Note: a C programmer can think of a <tt>class</tt> as a C <tt>struct</tt> whose members
default to <tt>private</tt>.  But if that's all you think of a <tt>class</tt>, then you
probably need to experience a personal paradigm shift.

</p><h3>[7.2] What is an object?</h3>
<p>A region of storage with associated semantics.
</p><p>After the declaration <tt>int&nbsp;i;</tt> we say that "<tt>i</tt> is an object of type <tt>int</tt>."
In OO/C++, "object" usually means "an instance of a class." Thus a class
defines the behavior of possibly many objects (instances).

</p><h3>[7.3] When is an interface "good"?</h3>
<p>When it provides a <em>simplified view</em> of a chunk of software, and it is
expressed in the <em>vocabulary of a user</em> (where a "chunk" is normally a
class or a <a indepth="true" href="friends.html#[14.2]">tight group of classes<!--rawtext:[14.2]:rawtext--></a>, and a "user"
is another developer rather than the ultimate customer).
</p><ul>
<li>The "simplified view" means unnecessary details are intentionally
hidden.  This reduces the user's defect-rate.</li>
<li>The "vocabulary of users" means users don't need to learn a new set
of words and concepts.  This reduces the user's learning curve.</li>
</ul>

</p><h3>[7.4] What is encapsulation?</h3>
<p>Preventing unauthorized access to some piece of information or functionality.
</p><p>The key money-saving insight is to separate the volatile part of some chunk of
software from the stable part.  Encapsulation puts a firewall around the chunk,
which prevents other chunks from accessing the volatile parts; other chunks can
only access the stable parts.  This prevents the other chunks from breaking if
(when!) the volatile parts are changed.  In context of OO software, a "chunk"
is normally a class or a <a indepth="true" href="friends.html#[14.2]">tight group of classes<!--rawtext:[14.2]:rawtext--></a>.
</p><p>The "volatile parts" are the implementation details.  If the chunk is a single
class, the volatile part is normally encapsulated using the <a indepth="true" href="basics-of-inheritance.html#[19.5]"><tt>private:</tt> and/or <tt>protected:</tt> keywords<!--rawtext:[19.5]:rawtext--></a>.  If the chunk is a
<a indepth="true" href="friends.html#[14.2]">tight group of classes<!--rawtext:[14.2]:rawtext--></a>, encapsulation can be used
to deny access to entire classes in that group.  <a indepth="true" href="basics-of-inheritance.html">Inheritance<!--rawtext:[19]:rawtext--></a> can also be used as <a indepth="true" href="abcs.html#[22.2]">a form of
encapsulation<!--rawtext:[22.2]:rawtext--></a>.
</p><p>The "stable parts" are the interfaces.  A good interface provides a
<a indepth="true" href="classes-and-objects.html#[7.3]">simplified view in the vocabulary of a user<!--rawtext:[7.3]:rawtext--></a>, and is
designed <a indepth="true" href="operator-overloading.html#[13.10]">from the outside-in<!--rawtext:[13.10]:rawtext--></a> (here a "user"
means another developer, not the end-user who buys the completed application).
If the chunk is a single class, the interface is simply the class's <tt>public:</tt>
member functions and <a indepth="true" href="friends.html"><tt>friend</tt><!--rawtext:[14]:rawtext--></a> functions.  If the chunk is a
<a indepth="true" href="friends.html#[14.2]">tight group of classes<!--rawtext:[14.2]:rawtext--></a>, the interface can include
several of the classes in the chunk.
</p><p>Designing a clean interface and <a indepth="true" href="abcs.html#[22.1]">separating
that interface from its implementation<!--rawtext:[22.1]:rawtext--></a> merely <em>allows</em> users to use
the interface.  But encapsulating (putting "in a capsule") the implementation
<em>forces</em> users to use the interface.

</p><h3>[7.5] How does C++ help with the tradeoff of safety <i>vs.</i>
usability?</h3>
<p>In C, <a indepth="true" href="classes-and-objects.html#[7.4]">encapsulation<!--rawtext:[7.4]:rawtext--></a> was accomplished by making things
<tt>static</tt> in a compilation unit or module.  This prevented another module from
accessing the <tt>static</tt> stuff.  (By the way, that use is now deprecated: don't
do that in C++.)
</p><p>Unfortunately this approach doesn't support multiple instances of the data,
since there is no direct support for making multiple instances of a module's
<tt>static</tt> data.  If multiple instances were needed in C, programmers typically
used a <tt>struct</tt>.  But unfortunately C <tt>struct</tt>s don't support
<a indepth="true" href="classes-and-objects.html#[7.4]">encapsulation<!--rawtext:[7.4]:rawtext--></a>.  This exacerbates the tradeoff between
safety (information hiding) and usability (multiple instances).
</p><p>In C++, you can have both multiple instances and encapsulation via a class.
The <tt>public:</tt> part of a class contains the class's interface, which normally
consists of the class's <tt>public:</tt> member functions and its <a indepth="true" href="friends.html"><tt>friend</tt><!--rawtext:[14]:rawtext--></a> functions.  The <a indepth="true" href="basics-of-inheritance.html#[19.5]"><tt>private:</tt> and/or
<tt>protected:</tt><!--rawtext:[19.5]:rawtext--></a> parts of a class contain the class's implementation, which
is typically where the data lives.
</p><p>The end result is like an "encapsulated <tt>struct</tt>." This reduces the tradeoff
between safety (information hiding) and usability (multiple instances).

<p><a name="[7.6]"></a>
</p><h3>[7.6] How can I prevent other programmers from
violating encapsulation by seeing the <tt>private</tt> parts of my class?</h3>
<p>Not worth the effort — encapsulation is for code, not people.
</p><p>It doesn't violate encapsulation for a <em>programmer</em> to see the
<a indepth="true" href="basics-of-inheritance.html#[19.5]"><tt>private:</tt> and/or <tt>protected:</tt><!--rawtext:[19.5]:rawtext--></a> parts of your class, so
long as they don't write code that somehow depends on what they saw.  In other
words, encapsulation doesn't prevent <em>people</em> from knowing about the
inside of a class; it prevents the <em>code</em> they write from becoming
dependent on the insides of the class.  Your company doesn't have to pay a
"maintenance cost" to maintain the gray matter between your ears; but it does
have to pay a maintenance cost to maintain the code that comes out of your
finger tips.  What you know as a person doesn't increase maintenance cost,
provided the code they write depends on the interface rather than the
implementation.
</p><p>Besides, this is rarely if ever a problem.  I don't know any programmers who
have intentionally tried to access the <tt>private</tt> parts of a class.  "My
recommendation in such cases would be to change the programmer, not the code"

</p><h3>[7.7] Is Encapsulation a Security device?</h3>
<p>No.
</p><p>Encapsulation <tt>!=</tt> security.
</p><p>Encapsulation prevents mistakes, not espionage.

<p><a name="[7.8]"></a>
</p><h3>[7.8] What's the difference between the keywords <tt>struct</tt> and
<tt>class</tt>?</h3>
<p>The members and base classes of a <tt>struct</tt> are <tt>public</tt> by default, while in
<tt>class</tt>, they default to <tt>private</tt>.  Note: you should make your base classes
<em>explicitly</em> <tt>public</tt>, <tt>private</tt>, or <tt>protected</tt>, rather than relying on
the defaults.
</p><p><tt>struct</tt> and <tt>class</tt> are otherwise functionally equivalent.
</p><p>OK, enough of that squeaky clean techno talk.  Emotionally, most developers
make a strong distinction between a <tt>class</tt> and a <tt>struct</tt>.  A <tt>struct</tt> simply
<em>feels</em> like an open pile of bits with very little in the way of
encapsulation or functionality.  A <tt>class</tt> <em>feels</em> like a living and
responsible member of society with intelligent services, a strong encapsulation
barrier, and a well defined interface.  Since that's the connotation most
people already have, you should probably use the <tt>struct</tt> keyword if you have a
class that has very few methods and has <tt>public</tt> data (such things <em>do</em>
exist in well designed systems!), but otherwise you should probably use the
<tt>class</tt> keyword.
